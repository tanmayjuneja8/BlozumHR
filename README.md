# BlozumHR

## The heavenly place where HR meets AI.

AI-based CV sorting, candidate fetching from CRM, ideal candidate comparison and candidate scoring based on job description. I used multiple LLMs to build this project as part of our last startup, BlozumHR (now pivoted to BlozumAI - https://blozum.com/)

You can find the website of the project at https://blozum-jhwk8pz5w-tanmayjuneja8.vercel.app/
We had built this product specifically for the Indian companies. We gathered all the data of Indian colleges and companies from websites like Glassdoor, AmbitionBox and official Indian Govt website which gives rankings to the colleges in India (NIRF).
We did this to evaluate the candidate solely based on the job description. We built anonymity in the hiring decision process based on the feedback. You may find different LLMs being used for different purposes of analysing the candidate here. We connected BlozumHR with Zoho's CRM and HRM to collect the data for one of our clients.
